## About
Hey everyone, this program was made after I was bothered every other second on what my rank was. I could have implemented a `!rank` command, but I thought of doing something unique. A program that checks your account every few seconds and sees your current rank and your point movement (unofficially). All of the code is open source, so anyone can check if the program is safe or not as you need to type in your Username and Password in the configuation file. As of writing this, there are no alternatives. I will say it now, I will not verify if alternatives are safe. I know my program is safe, and anyone can check if that statment is vaild.

# Message For Riot
Hey Riot, so I know that you are probably reading this since you guys love me so much on twitter on @Valorleaks (love you back). Regardless, if this program is not something you want out there, please message me through twitter (@RumbleMikee). Otherwise, this program is not injecting or modifying the game in any sort of way. It is simply just making a webrequest to your API which then returns a json that I parse and display. Thanks <3
